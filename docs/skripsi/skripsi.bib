@article{Friedman1997,
   abstract = {"Background subtraction" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence-for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a time­ averaged background image will leave only non­ stationary objects. It is, however, a crude ap­ proximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classi­ fication model for each pixel using an unsuper­ vised technique-an efficient, incremental ver­ sion of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Ap­ plication of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.},

   abstract = {A common method for real-time segmentation of moving regions in image sequences involves "back-ground subtraction," or thresholding the error between an estimate of the image without moving objects and the current image. The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaus-sians and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The Gaussian distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through rain and snow.},

The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of l-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.},

   abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects. © 2006 ACM.},

Fundamentals of Object Tracking tells you how. Starting with the generic object tracking problem, it outlines the generic Bayesian solution. It then shows systematically how to formulate the major tracking problems-maneuvering, multi-object, clutter, out-of-sequence sensors-within this Bayesian framework and how to derive the standard tracking solutions. This structured approach makes very complex object tracking algorithms accessible to the growing number of users working on real-world tracking problems and supports them in designing their own tracking filters under their unique application constraints. The book concludes with a chapter on issues critical to the successful implementation of tracking algorithms, such as track initialization and merging.},

The goal of this study is to provide a solid analytic ground to underscore the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely implemented motion detection methods. The methods are compared based on their robustness to different types of video, their memory requirement, and the computational effort they require. The impact of a Markovian prior as well as some post-processing operators are also evaluated. Most of the videos used in this study come from state-of-the-art benchmark databases and represent different challenges such as poor signal-tonoise ratio, multimodal background motion and camera jitter. Overall, this study not only helps better understand to which type of videos each method suits best but also estimate how better sophisticated methods are compared to basic background subtraction methods.},

However using human in surveillance has its own disadvantage; to overcome that limitation researchers are working in automated visual surveillance systems. The visual surveillance process comprises of the following steps: environment modelling, motion segmentation, object classification, tracking, behaviour understanding, human identification and data fusion. The first and foremost step in visual surveillance is identifying moving objects in a video sequence. The moving object of interest may be human being, vehicle, etc. Object detection is the technology that deals with identifying the semantic class of the moving object in the video sequence. Hence Object Detection is very vital for tracking moving object and behaviour analysis in the given video sequence. Considering the importance of object detection in visual surveillance, this paper presents various methods available for object detection. Automatic Visual surveillance has wide area of applications such as human identification at a distance, monitoring the congestion, detection of anomalous behaviours etc.},

In addition, moving object detection is very consequential and efficacious research topic in field of computer vision and video processing since it forms a critical step for many complex processes like video object classification and video tracking activity. Consequently, identification of actual shape of moving object from a given sequence of video frames becomes pertinent. However, task of detecting actual shape of object in motion becomes tricky due to various challenges like dynamic scene changes, illumination variations, presence of shadow, camouflage and bootstrapping problem. To reduce the effect of these problems, researchers have proposed number of new approaches. This paper provides a brief classification of the classical approaches for moving object detection. Further, paper reviews recent research trends to detect moving object for single stationary camera along with discussion of key points and limitations of each approach.},

   abstract = {Visual analysis of complex fish habitats is an important step towards sustainable fisheries for human consumption and environmental protection. Deep Learning methods have shown great promise for scene analysis when trained on largescale datasets. However, current datasets for fish analysis tend to focus on the classification task within constrained, plain environments which do not capture the complexity of underwater fish habitats. To address this limitation, we present DeepFish as a benchmark suite with a large-scale dataset to train and test methods for several computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of approximately 40 thousand images collected underwater from 20 habitats in the marine-environments of tropical Australia. The dataset originally contained only classification labels. Thus, we collected point-level and segmentation labels to have a more comprehensive fish analysis benchmark. These labels enable models to learn to automatically monitor fish count, identify their locations, and estimate their sizes. Our experiments provide an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, and the performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark. Although models pre-trained on ImageNet have successfully performed on this benchmark, there is still room for improvement. Therefore, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in this challenging domain of underwater computer vision.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate “reasonable bounds” – linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},
